# I-Need-Space
Wana free up some space ?
These are work-in-progress python command-line tools that you can use to free up some space on your pc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For now, you can use the emptynator script to delete the empty folders and files in a specific directory you choose.I know what you are thinkin "Empty do not occupy space!" but their metadata does and if you have lots of them, they can add up and occupy a non-trivial amount of space collectively. Removing them can free up some storage space, especially if you have a limited amount of disk space available.

# Easy Start
First, make sure you have python3 installed then the classic clone and execute:
python3 emptynator.py target_directory
